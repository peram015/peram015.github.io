 <h1>The Kellen Archives</h1>
 <h2>Small, but Useful</h2>

<p>The Kellen Archives holds works by distinct Parsons alumn, faculty and students that chooses to make a donation. 
Made up almost entirely of Anything that students specifically ask for can be brought over to the 25 West 13th building in less than two hours.
The archive is made up entirely of two-dimensional pieces and renderings that often have preceded the creation of garments. 
For example, the archive holds swatches and flats that usually accompany the design of a collection. 
This proves to be a great resource for fashion students not only to see the works of their idols who 
walked the halls of The New School before them, but also to see how the process of design has evolved over time. 
Most of the archival content that they get from New School alumni, they receive once they have passed away. 
While they don’t receive new content regularly, student work is widely accepted at any time. 
<br/> 
When asked about the existence of a similar archival collection that only holds garments, as opposed to renderings, Jeanne Swadosh was stunned and 
admitted to not knowing much about the mysterious “archive” that lives on the eighth floor of that same building.
However, she believes that having an archived collection of garments, much like that in the Kellen Archives, would be very beneficial to students in 
fashion design or fashion studies programs.
The students that visit the Kellen archives are generally research students with a particular topic in mind.
The very friendly online version of the archives, along with the group of people who are familiar with everything that forms a part of their collection is helpful for any student who wants to decide on a topic before researching more in depth.
Additionally, they have, in recent years, taken advantage of technology to expand into including many new and current works from the department of Photography at Parsons.
This department is responsible for sending student work that would be worth keeping in archive. The Kellen Archives make up a small room in 25 West 19th. 
<br/>
Although Jeanne says that they could always use more space, the very organized and beautiful room is inviting and doesn’t feel uncomfortably small.
More than fifty percent of the items owned by the Kellen Archives are in storage offsite. This is not an uncommon practice for city archives. 
The Kellen Archives use the same storage than the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum and New York University. 
This storage facilitates the use and effectiveness of receiving this information when needed. 
The Kellen Archives employ four full time workers that keep the archives organized and work in helping students find whatever they need at the archives.
Although most of the students who take advantage of the archives are in a Masters program, students in the Undergraduate program are widely aware of the existence of these archives and have the possibility to use it at any moment. 
There are orientations for students upon coming to the New School that explain the archives and their purpose in the school, so most of the students interviewed said they were aware of this resource.  
<br/>
Additionally, this archive has helped to promote the practice of archiving in general. A lot of the work that is being produced now by students might be useful someday to other generations of 
New School students. When The New School of Fashion moved campus, the Kellen Archives released the advertisement below as an urge for students not to throw out their work but to submit it to the archives. 
The same also happened recently, when Mannes School of Jazz moved campus.
