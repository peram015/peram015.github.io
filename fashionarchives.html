When questioned about their knowledge of a fashion archive, New School students responded with a resounding “no”. The Parsons School Of Fashion prides itself in having a vast archive of renderings, books and magazines that are known as the Kellen archives. Students are generally unaware, however, that hidden in the 8th floor of 66 Fifth avenue, interrupting the “model coordinator”’s office is a collection of garments that have been accumulated over time.

A couple of years ago, the humble collection grew to include contributions from the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum. Now, Parsons has access to a very valuable collection of garments including designs from the first collection that Yves Saint Laurent designed for the House of Christian Dior. This seemingly mythical archive is said to house one of the greatest collections of 1920s American Sportswear— the epic style that turned New York into a fashion capital.

Michelle McVicker, from whom I originally heard about the existence of this archive, is very passionate about museum curation and understands the process of cataloguing archives. Upon coming to the New School to pursue her Master’s Program in Fashion Studies, Michelle was most excited for the opportunity to do “Objects-based research”, as the program’s description explained. She quickly found out that the program is much more theory-based than the program description suggested, and she had very little interaction with garments.

She explained to me that part of collection management in Museums or archives involves giving each item an accession number, yeah of donation, and description to take inventory of everything the archive holds. Since Parsons had gained different pieces from other museums, the archive would require an all new database particular only to the Parsons archive. This is a task that requires a job position which Parsons doesn’t offer and isn’t considering. This, in particular, is the reason that the archives remain unaccessible.

Michelle, along with concerned faculty Tae Smith, have studied the archive and noticed that not only do they have harsh, white lighting which is extremely damaging for clothes, but all garments are living crammed in plastic hangers and some even still in Dry Clean bags. She even claims to have seen a dead cockroach on the floor one time.

“For someone who is interested in that, it just makes you cringe because there’s such valuable stuff here and it’s not being taken care of.” 
<br/>

Enthusiastic about the prospect of improving the functionality of the Parsons archive, Michelle proposed an independent study for Spring 2015. Her job would be to start cataloguing the archive in a new, searchable database that would organize and facilitate the use of the archive. Within two weeks of her independent study, Michelle was contacted by her advisor who told her that— for no particular reason—, she was no longer allowed to continue creating this database and that she should instead write an essay on one of the designers in the collection.

McKiver is certain that, had she continued working on the archive, it would be in a much better state now.

Fashion Design at Parsons is a theory-based program. However; many, like New School Professor Tae Smith; believe that the understanding of construction and materiality are crucial for a successful fashion career. With this ideal in mind, Sarah Scettero of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum designed a course called Materiality, which is meant to focus on the physical construction of garments. Access to the incredible garments that exist in the Parsons archive would enrich courses and student’s designs.

After a meeting regarding the treatment of the Parsons Archive which was held in Fall of 2014, the case was made for the innumerable benefits that come from having an archive that students are proud of and that the school can advertise as part of their Fashion program.

Almost a year has passed since this meeting and nothing has been done to change the disastrous state of this collection. Not only has there not been any change, but efforts to do so, like McKiver’s independent study, have been shut down. Parsons prides itself in being a school that is at the forefront of the new and revolutionary, which is why anything that revels in the past is put on the back-burner in the list of priorities.

“To me its frightening how you guys (current undergraduates) are the designers of tomorrow because if you don’t understand how we got to today, there is no real modernity.”
<br/>

After speaking to the Associate Director of the School of Fashion, it became clear to me that they didn't consider the organization of this fashion collection a priority. When asked about what immediate plans were in place to fix this space, Fiona Dieffenbacher responded vaguely with the excuse that Parson's recent move is the reason for the current state of the collection. In fact, when I approached her asking to see and learn more about the archives, the response was much like what Michelle had received. They immediately asked me how I heard about the collection
and what faculty had prompted me to come asking for it. They are unsure about how many pieces and what specific things they have, but there are enough pieces to make a decent archival collection. Signs in the eighth floor of the building indicate that Room 822 is the "Fashion Archive." When I approached 822, I noticed that the plate read "Model Coordinator", instead. 
Instead of tackling the organization of the archive and using it for students' advantage, the School of Fashion has taken a different direction-- one that instead avoids the problem and don't talk about it so students won't find out 
that the archive even exists. Most of the students who didn't know about the existence of this archive were angered by the fact that they don't have access to 
something this relevant. "We could be experiencing the styles and construction that we constantly read about in fashion history books." commented Valeria Maxera, 
a student on her second year of fashion design at Parsons. "It's just a waste of money. They should put them where people can see them-- around the University Center lobby. Make an exhibit. Make it cool." proposed Carmen Llaguno, also on her second year in fashion design. 
One thing is true: nobody is not benefitting from a messy closet full of moldy Dior gowns.
