            This book is about the designing of Miuccia Prada’s Fall Winter 2017 womenswear collection. More specifically, however, this book was designed in consideration and analysis of the fashion industry and the structure under which it functions.
            <br><br>
            As a removed audience, designer collections are only available to view and understand through one’s own research: visual imagery collected from various sites of both the collections themselves and the space in which they are presented, as well as collection reviews written by third-party attendees of whichever fashion presentation.

            I always find that when fashion consumers, not buyers, but purely visual consumers, are involved in a discussion about a fashion collection, there’s always a sort of competition about how much you know. From the standpoint of a fan who sees the show digitally but never attends or sees the clothes in person, I find it intimidating to talk about the intention behind a collection.
            <br><br>
            This is because the distance that exists between someone like myself and the designer makes it impossible to fully understand. Even during modern times of social media, which have facilitated the distribution of less-mediated fashion imagery, any inspiration that goes beyond the physical appearance of the clothes can only be inferred but never confirmed as truth.

            This book archives information on Prada’s collection from the most visual to the most referential. From the most available to the fan, to the only available to the designer. The pages in the book get farther away from view as the book goes on, as is the case with information of its type. Finally, the content disappears into the gutter, leaving the question of intent a mystery.
