            Luli Peralta,</a>
            &#160;
            am a multi-disciplinary designer based in New York City. I know that 'multi-disciplinary' offers no specificity about what I do, but at this point in my career, there is no one medium that encompasses my work. I ask questions and attempt to answer them visually, a process that can materialize into any medium.
            <br></br>
            I am moved by systems between people and people, between people and things, and how time alters both. My work questions these systems in the present, and designs them in futures.
