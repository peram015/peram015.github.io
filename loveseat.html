              <span id="bold">The Loveseat</span> is an imagined commercial universe where two people are required to purchase one object. Think of it as one-for-two instead of the familiar two-for-one.
              <br><br>
              With only one object to share, there is an interest in both parties to protect its durability, and the object also develops intangible value. Under this proposed concept, the act of purchasing is considered a social one, and the communication that now connects both participants is the ultimate benefit, and the object purchased simply acts as a currency in the exchange.
            <br><br>
              I documented this in a book which illustrates three different stories of couples sharing objects under the premise of <span id="bold">The Loveseat.</span> Each scenario involves two people and one shared object. However, the negotiation of sharing differs in each. These scenarios highlight how the re-design of an economic model demands a change in the design of products to accommodate, while also demonstrating the agency in negotiation that this specific system offers to those involved.

            The book is designed as a shared reading experience, where a character is assigned to each reader and the story told through the images becomes relatable to those interacting with it.
