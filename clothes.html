            When thinking of New York, the first thing that comes to mind is the epic skyline. In all its infamy, this image is a universal and impersonal depiction of New York. New York’s skyline promises wealth and luxury as much as it confirms a reputation of being cold, harsh and overwhelming.

            After my first Wednesday at Bushwick’s “Drink and Draw”, all I could think of was the nude model. After four years of art school, this shouldn’t come as a shock. I don’t know if it was the beer or the amount of people packed into the small studio that made the girl seem violently naked.
            <br><br>
            While I have never undressed to a room full of strangers, I think I know the feeling. I have never felt more exposed than in New York. Here, there is little sense of security, and it is easy to get lost in greed as you cling to comparison for self-awareness. This idea became a collection of three looks as a sartorial illustration of this New York problem.

            This collection focuses on the back of the body as an attempt of self-protection. All garments are made with less than four pattern pieces, keeping the use of seams to a minimum. This, in addition to the double-layer fabric that is fused together gives strength, made to be felt by the wearer as a metaphor of companionship.
            <br><br>
            Luxury home fabrics intended for furniture, put in the context of clothes, coupled with the use of men’s dress shirt fabric expresses unattainable security. In its accentuated waists and rigidness of the cuts, the pieces allude to the promise of wealth, success and beauty that are embedded in the image of New York's skyline.
